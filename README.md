# Image-Processing-using-Python-and-Open-CV

This project involves developing an object detection system using Python and Google Colab. By using OpenCV and machine learning libraries, the system can accurately identify and locate objects within images, detect colors, and recognize shapes. It improves computer vision capabilities with deep learning techniques, allowing for robust and efficient real-time object detection for various applications.
